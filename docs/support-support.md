## General

Why would FirmWorks Support need access to my Organization?

    FirmWorks Support may ask you to Grant Login Access in order to assist you with a question, issue, or request.

    This is so that Support can log in to the application using your login to troubleshoot and fix issues stemming from your inquiry.

    No one within FirmWorks Support may log in to your Org to resolve issues without this explicit permission and duration for the access.

## Additional Notes

You cannot grant login access if you're logged in as another User via their login access. For example, a System Administrator cannot login as an end User and grant login access to FirmWorks Support. Similarly, if the Admin has the feature 'Organization Admins can Login as Any User' privilege, FirmWorks Support cannot login as a System Admin and then login as any User in their Organization. If Support needs access to both the end user and the Admin's account, both the Admin and end User will need to grant access separately.
