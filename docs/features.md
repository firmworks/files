### Suggested Links To Records

Enable your users to quickly give access to related records using suggested links.

Suggested links look at the currently linked records to the file and gives a one click option to create relationships to related records.

Example - This file was linked to an opportunity. By using a FirmWorks Files configuration the suggested path of 'AccountId' is used to suggest the Account 'DIA' for the Opportunity 'DIA'.

## File Reporting

Report on files and their field values - something not currently available in Salesforce

This example looks for all Accounts where an opportunity has been set to Closed Won within the last fiscal quarter, that also have a file title with 'MSA' in it (we recommend using picklists in practice). The power here is that not only can you find Accounts in Compliance with your legal standards - you can quickly find Accounts that are OUT of compliance as well by switching to Records without documents.

## File Auditing and Compliance

Reports can be built to your exacting requirements and scheduled to run on your schedule. Scheduled reports produce Salesforce Platform Events that can be used to drive the behavior and activities required to keep your company in compliance.

## Record Reports

Save a report and drop a component on a layout to help alert your users if documentation is missing.
